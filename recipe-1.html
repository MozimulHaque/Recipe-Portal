                    <h2>Kheer</h2>
                    <p>
                        Kheer is a popular Indian rice pudding that's rich, creamy, and delicately flavored. It's
                        typically made by simmering rice in milk and sugar until it thickens, resulting in a comforting
                        and sweet dessert. The rice is cooked until soft and melds beautifully with the creamy milk.
                        Often, aromatic ingredients like cardamom, saffron, and nuts such as almonds, cashews, or
                        pistachios are added to enhance the flavor and texture. Kheer can be served warm or chilled,
                        garnished with a sprinkle of nuts or dried fruits on top. It's a beloved dish in Indian cuisine
                        and is often made during festivals, celebrations, or simply enjoyed as a comforting treat.

                            <p>Step 1: Cooking the Rice in Milk</p>

                            In a heavy-bottomed pan or pot, bring the milk to a boil over medium heat.
                            Add the rinsed Basmati rice to the boiling milk and stir well.
                            Reduce the heat to low and let the rice simmer in the milk. Stir occasionally to prevent
                            sticking to the bottom.
                            Continue cooking until the rice is soft and the milk has thickened, which typically takes
                            around 30-40 minutes. Be patient; this slow cooking is what gives kheer its creamy texture.

                            Once the rice is cooked and the mixture has thickened, add sugar and crushed cardamom pods.
                            Stir well until the sugar dissolves completely.
                            If using saffron, dissolve it in a tablespoon of warm milk and add it to the kheer for a
                            subtle flavor and a beautiful golden hue.
                            Optionally, add a teaspoon of rosewater or kewra water for additional fragrance. Stir gently
                            to incorporate.

                            Toast the assorted nuts in a separate pan until lightly golden and aromatic.
                            Add the toasted nuts (reserving some for garnish) and raisins, if using, into the kheer. Mix
                            well.
                            Turn off the heat and let the kheer cool down a bit.
                            Serve the kheer warm or chilled, garnished with the remaining nuts and a few strands of
                            saffron on top.
